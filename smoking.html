    <h1 class="header">The Benefits of Smoking</h1>
    <h2 class="header">
      Decontructing the misunderstood effects of smoking
    </h2>
    <p>
        Smoking has been demonized since the late 80s and has never been able to change its image.
        Grotesque and hyperbolic anti-smoking campaigns assaulted the public eye in every medium
        possible, all in response to an outlier statistic inexplicably linking smoking to localized
        cancer. Smoking has been around since the dawn of man and we never had a problem with it
        before, however the tides, they are a'changing. Self-rightous political activist and social
        justic warriors continue to bang their alarmist drums for a myriad of nefarious reasons:
        anti-capitalistic sentiment, misanthropy for the past, or simply uneducated and unguided
        activism.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here are some of the more obsured symptoms of chronic smoking we've come across:
    <ul>
        <li>1400% increase risk of lunch, throat, and/or mouth cancer</li>
        <li>100% increase risk of heart attach</li>
        <li>400% increase risk of cancer of the esophagus</li>
        <li>200% increase risk peptic ulcer disease</li>
        <li>Increase risks for respiratory illnesses</li>
    </ul>
        Not only are these statistics untrue, they are an alarming indicator of the systemic corruption 
        that exist between our medical community and the smoking community we all hold so dear. There 
        will be the heretics that continue to spread misinformation about smoking, quoting pseudo-medical 
        articles and documents that support their claims. 
      <br> 
      <br>
        However I do believe the majority of the opposition are just misinformed and simply don't know 
        any better. They've never smoked. They've never felt that smooth rush of cool that permeates 
        their bodies and minds after each inhale. The confidence and mental clarity gained from just a 
        simple drag is lost upon them, and smoking has been villified to the point that they won't 
        even try it for themselves.

    <p>
        This is why I am starting the worlds first "See through the Smoke" Campaign where we will provide adequate smoking materials and education to at-risk populations all over the continental United States. I want to be the first person in their lives to hand them their first cigarette, light it for them and tell them to enjoy the ride. Then I believe they will finally understand what they were missing and that the heresay of the modern medical community was only a temporary false idol.
