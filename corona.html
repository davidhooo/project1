      Under the sterile lights of a world-class but hidden biochemical research facility, Yoshihiro
      Kawaoka meticulously aligns eight viral segments into negative-strand orientation and injects
      them into several host cells cultivated only hours ago. Twelve hours later, in a microscopic
      avalanche, hundreds of host cell burst open spewing highly infectious virus particles. This
      was the beginning of the end. This was ground zero.

      Yoshihiro Kawaoka, playfully known as Yoshi, was a world renown biochemist. He recieved his
      Masters in Biochemistry from UC-Berkeley and recieved his PhD in Virology from Zhejiang
      University under the esteemed mentorship of Peter Piot, the same man who created the vaccine
      for SARS-12.

      Yoshi's future was bright and people knew it. He was profiled in countless articles and
      magazines to be Messiah of gene therapy, the man to finally unlock the blueprint of the human
      species. With the world's hopes and expectations on his shoulders, Yoshi felt an foreboding
      obligation to provide these answers that perhaps shouldn't have been uncovered in the first
      place.
